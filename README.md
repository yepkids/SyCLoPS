Introduction
=====

The System for classification of Low-Pressure Systems (SyCLoPS) is an all-in-one framework for objective detection and classification of any type of surface low-pressure systems (LPSs) in any large atmospheric dataset and model outputs in one workflow. The required atmopsheric variables for the framework can be found at `manual/Required_variable.png`. SyCLoPS is capable of labeling the following types of LPS:

| LPS node Label         | LPS Full Name                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| HAL / HATHL            | High-altitude Low / High-altitude Thermal Low      |
| THL / DOTHL            | Thermal Low / Deep (Orographic) Thermal Low        | 
| DSD / DST / DSE        | Dry / Tropical/ Extratropical Disturbance          |
| TC                     | Tropical Cyclone                                   |
| TD / TD(MD)            | Tropical Depression / TD (Monsoon Depression)      |
| TLO / TLO(ML)          | Tropical Low / TLO (Monsoon Low)                   |
| SS(STLC) / PL(PTLC)    | Subtropical Storm (Subtropical Tropical-Like Cyclone) / Polar Low (Polar TLC) |
| SC / EX                | Subtropical Cyclone / Extratropical Cyclone        |

It also labels the four high-impact LPS tracks: TC, MS (Monsoonal System), SS(STLC), and PL(PTLC) tracks. Tracks are labeled when LPSs are stably labeld as a type of LPS class for a period of time so it can be compared with the corresponding subjective dataset.

Usage
=====

Simply download the SyCLoPS folder to your machine. Then: 

1. Review the codes and comments in `SyCLoPS_main.py`. Change variable names and other specifications according to your needs.

2. Run `SyCLoPS_main.py` and follow the instructions carefully.

Optional steps for tagging precipitation and size blobs of LPSs can be found in the `optional` folder.
